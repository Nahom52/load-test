# **Machine Learning**
In this project, we tried to apply the three machine-learning classification techniques
Linear regression, Logistic regression, and Naive Bayes to the mnist, BBC, and weather data set.

# **Tools**
- we mainly used Python for developing this project.
- we were able to aquire the mnist data set from the tensor flow, a machine learning platform
- we had access to the BBC and weather data set via CSV files.
- we used matplotlib to prepare the graphs the depict the accuracy level of each classification technique
  for different parameters.

# **How to use**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone nahom4/Ai`
2. Open the folder in a code editor.
3. install tensor flow `pip install tensorflow`.
4. install mathplotlib `pip install mathplotlib`.
5. Run the code.
